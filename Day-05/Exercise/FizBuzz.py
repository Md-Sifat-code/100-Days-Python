#  This code will run a for loop range type . in the loop the range is mentioned like (0,100) here the 0 means the number ranger will start from here
# it will end on 100 . The main logic of this code is to check conditional operation in the for loop
#  It will print Fizz if the number is perfectly devied by the 3 and Buzz if the number devided by 5.
#  Others it will just print the number stored into the x
